## Description
Simulates a amiga guru on a website. 
For nostalgic reasons and my personal fun, of course ;). Very useful for a 404 page. 

It also utilizes the TurkishTopaz WebFont from https://github.com/emartisoft/AmigaTopazFont to give it a more authentic look.

Even for a authentic feeling: the error messages exists, but also of course not in this web context. 
And the shown memory adresses are of course totally bogus. 

## Installation

None, as it is all in a one-pager. CSS,js,and HTML in a single file. 
Just add it where you want and call the index.html file with a browser.   

## Vertical position on top

If you want to be more accurate and want a guru on the top of your page.
Just change the line 27 from the index.html

``
height: 100vh;
``

to

``
height: 0%;
``
